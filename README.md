"*[matrix functions.ipynb](https://github.com/jlee92603/Python-Functions/blob/c0d5ae5a18e473f0541504135e65077d70447cff/matrix%20functions.ipynb)*" demonstrates several basic matrix functions, including matrix multiplication, transposition, rotation, finding determinants and inverse of matrices, and executing caussian elimination. 

"*[UV_decomposition.ipynb](https://github.com/jlee92603/Python-Functions/blob/c0d5ae5a18e473f0541504135e65077d70447cff/UV_decomposition.ipynb)*" demonstrates a simple usage of UV decomposition, which is a type of matrix factorization that uses U and V matrices to create an estimate of values for a matrix. It finds the closes pair of matrices, U and V, whose product, M-hat, is close to the given matrix M. This can be useful in recommender systems, such as with movies or shopping, where it can make matrices from user and product data to create matrices with estimated values in order to recommend products to users.
